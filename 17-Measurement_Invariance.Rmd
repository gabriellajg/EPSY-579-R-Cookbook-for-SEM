# Lavaan Lab 14: Measurement Invariance

For this lab, we will run the MG-CFA analyses in class using simulated data based on Todd Little's positive affect example.

Load up the lavaan library:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(lavaan)
```

and the dataset:

```{r}
affectData <- read.csv("cfaInclassData.csv", header = T)
```

For demonstration purposes, let's first simulate a grouping variable called school:

```{r}
set.seed(555)
affectData$school = sample(c('public', 'private'), nrow(affectData), replace = T)
table(affectData$school)
head(affectData)
```

The goal of testing measurement invariance (MI) is to make sure that the scale that measures positive affect and satisfaction functions in the same way between public and private schools.

## PART I: Multi-Group Analyses, Done Incorrectly
<!------------------------------>

Syntax for an SR model (it doesn't matter whether the model is for CFA or SR, the test of MI only applies to the CFA part): 

```{r}
srSyntax <- "
	posAffect =~ glad + happy + cheerful 
	satisfaction =~ satisfied + content + comfortable 
	
	# Structural Regression: beta
	satisfaction ~ posAffect
	"
```

```{r}
MGsrRunWRONG <- lavaan::sem(srSyntax, 
                    data = affectData, 
                    fixed.x=FALSE,
                    group = "school", # group indicator
                    estimator = "MLR") # use MLR as a go-to estimation method

summary(MGsrRunWRONG, standardized = T, fit.measures = T)
```

```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(semPlot)
semPaths(MGsrRunWRONG, what='est', 
         nCharNodes = 0,
         nCharEdges = 0, # don't limit variable name lengths
         edge.label.cex=0.6, 
         curvePivot = TRUE, 
         curve = 1.5, # pull covariances' curves out a little
         fade=FALSE)
```


<!------------------------------>
## PART II: Testing Measurement Invariance
<!------------------------------>

### step 1: Configural invariance

If you simply use the MGsrRunWRONG synatx above, you are just testing configural invariance: 

```{r}
configuralFit <- lavaan::sem(srSyntax, 
                    data = affectData, 
                    fixed.x=FALSE,
                    group = "school", # group indicator
                    estimator = "MLR") # use MLR as a go-to estimation method
#summary(configuralFit, standardized = T, fit.measures = T)
```

+ Configural invariance was established due to satisfying model fit; 

### step 2: Metric (weak) invariance

To test metric invariance, you could manually constraint all factor loadings to be the same using tricks like "posAffect =~ c(lam1, lam1)*glad" but there is a shortcut using "group.equal" argument:

```{r}
metricFit <- lavaan::sem(srSyntax, 
                 data = affectData, 
                 fixed.x=FALSE,
                 estimator = 'MLR',
                 group = "school", 
                 group.equal = c("loadings")) 
```

+ so that all factor loadings are fixed to be the same across groups
+ More group equality constraints can be added, like "intercepts", "means", "residuals", "residual.covariances", "lv.variances", "lv.covariances", "regressions"

```{r}
summary(metricFit, standardized = T, fit.measures = T)
```

+ Again, metric invariance was established due to satisfying model fit; 
+ To test whether the equal factor loading assumption caused damage to model fit, we compare metricFit to configuralFit: 

Model comparison: 

```{r}
anova(configuralFit, metricFit)
```

+ The test was not significant, meaning the increase in chi-square (due to the assumption of equal factor loadings) was not substantial enough to worsen the model fit; 
+ Note that this test suffers from the same problem as the chi-square test (too sensitive to model misfit)

### step 3: Scalar (strong) Invariance

In this step, both factor loadings and measurement intercepts (of course, including factor structure) are constrained to be equal between the groups: 

```{r}
scalarFit <- lavaan::sem(srSyntax, 
                 data = affectData, 
                 fixed.x=FALSE,
                 estimator = 'MLR',
                 group = "school", 
                 group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts")) 
summary(scalarFit, standardized = T, fit.measures = T)
```

Model comparison: 

```{r}
anova(metricFit, scalarFit)
```

+ The test was not significant, meaning the increase in chi-square (due to the assumption of equal measurement intercepts) was not substantial enough to worsen the model fit; 
+ Scalar invariance was established; 

### step 4: (Optional) Residual variance (strict) invariance 

```{r}
resVarFit <- lavaan::sem(srSyntax, 
                 data = affectData, 
                 fixed.x=FALSE,
                 estimator = 'MLR',
                 group = "school", 
                 group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals")) 
summary(resVarFit, standardized = T, fit.measures = T)
```

Model comparison: 

```{r}
anova(resVarFit, scalarFit)
```

+ The test was not significant, meaning the increase in chi-square (due to the assumption of equal residual variances) was not substantial enough to worsen the model fit; 
+ Strict invariance was established. 

<!------------------------------>
## PART III: Shortcut to performing MI
<!------------------------------>

### measurementInvariance()

There is a shortcut function in package 'semTools' that performs invariance testing in one place, but unfortunately it will soon retire...

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(semTools)

measurementInvariance(model = srSyntax, 
                      data = affectData, 
                      fixed.x=FALSE,
                      estimator = 'MLR', 
                      group = "school")
```

### measEq.syntax()

To use measEq.syntax() from semTools, we need to use a model syntax for CFA model instead of SR model: 

```{r}
cfaSyntax <- "
	posAffect =~ glad + happy + cheerful 
	satisfaction =~ satisfied + content + comfortable 
	"
```

```{r}
test.seq <- list(weak = c("loadings"),
                 strong = c("intercepts"),
                 strict = c("residuals"))
meq.list <- list()
for (i in 0:length(test.seq)) {
  if (i == 0L) {
    meq.label <- "configural"
    group.equal <- ""
  } else {
    meq.label <- names(test.seq)[i]
    group.equal <- unlist(test.seq[1:i])
  }
  meq.list[[meq.label]] <- measEq.syntax(configural.model = cfaSyntax,
                                         data = affectData,
                                         fixed.x = TRUE,
                                         estimator = 'MLR', 
                                         group = "school",
                                         group.equal = group.equal,
                                         return.fit = TRUE)
}
```

```{r}
summary(compareFit(meq.list))
```

According to Putnick & Bornstein (2016):

* Some researchers have shifted from a focus on absolute fit in terms of $\chi^2$ to a focus on alternative fit indices because $\chi^2$ is overly sensitive to small, unimportant deviations from a “perfect” model in large samples (Chen, 2007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002; French & Finch, 2006; Meade, Johnson, & Braddy, 2008).
*  Cheung and Rensvold's (2002) criterion of a -.01 change in CFI for nested models is commonly used, but other researchers have suggested different criteria for CFI (Meade et al., 2008; Rutkowski & Svetina, 2014). 
* This means in the last section of "Differences in Fit Indices", a positive 'cfi.robust' or a negative 'cfi.robust'>= -.01 helps establish measurement noninvariance.  


<!------------------------------>
## PART IV: Multi-Group CFA Modeling, done right
<!------------------------------>

+ To compare the structural model parameters, at least scalar (strong) invariance is required; 
+ Since strict invariance was also satisfied, we will use resVarFit for MG-SR Modeling in this example:

### Statistical Test of Equal Factor Means:

```{r}
equalMeanfit <- lavaan::sem(cfaSyntax, 
                    affectData, 
                    fixed.x = FALSE, 
                    estimator = 'MLR', 
                    group = "school", 
                    group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals", 
                                    "means"))

summary(equalMeanfit, standardized = T, fit.measures = T)

anova(resVarFit, equalMeanfit)
```

+ The anova test was not significant, meaning the increase in chi-square (due to the constraint of equal latent means) was not substantial enough to worsen the model fit; 
+ It says the levels of positive affect and satisfaction in public schools were essentially the same as those in private schools. 

### Statistical Test of Equal Regression Coefficients:

+ Note that we used srSyntax here because we need to define the regression coefficient between PA and satisfaction: 

```{r}
equalBetafit <- lavaan::sem(srSyntax, 
                    affectData, 
                    fixed.x = FALSE, 
                    estimator = 'MLR', 
                    group = "school", 
                    group.equal = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals",
                                 "regressions"))

summary(equalBetafit, standardized = T, fit.measures = T)

anova(resVarFit, equalBetafit)
```

+ The test was not significant, meaning the increase in chi-square (due to the constraint of equal regression coefficients) was not substantial enough to worsen the model fit; 
+ It says the effect of positive affect on satisfaction in public schools was essentially the same as that in private schools.
